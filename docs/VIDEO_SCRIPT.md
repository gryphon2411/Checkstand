# Checkstand Video Demo Script
**Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge Submission**
*Target Duration: 3-4 minutes*

## **SCENE 1: Hook & Problem Statement** *(0:00 - 0:45)*

### **Opening Hook** *(0:00 - 0:15)*
**[Show pile of crumpled receipts on desk]**

**NARRATOR**: "We've all been here. Receipts scattered everywhere, trying to track expenses manually, wondering where our money went. But what if I told you there's a better way - one that doesn't compromise your privacy?"

### **Problem Setup** *(0:15 - 0:45)*
**[Split screen: Manual receipt entry vs cloud upload concerns]**

**NARRATOR**: "Traditional solutions force you to choose: either spend hours manually entering data, or upload your financial information to the cloud where it can be breached, sold, or accessed by third parties. There has to be a better way."

## **SCENE 2: Solution Introduction** *(0:45 - 1:15)*

### **Meet Checkstand** *(0:45 - 1:00)*
**[Show Checkstand app loading on phone]**

**NARRATOR**: "Meet Checkstand - AI-powered receipt scanning that works completely offline. Built for the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge, Checkstand proves that privacy and convenience don't have to be mutually exclusive."

### **The "Bigger Than Chatbot" Moment** *(1:00 - 1:15)*
**[Show Google Gemma 3n logo transition to Checkstand interface]**

**NARRATOR**: "The challenge asked us to think bigger than a simple chatbot. Checkstand answers that call by turning your phone into a privacy-preserving financial assistant that never sends your data anywhere."

## **SCENE 3: Live Demonstration** *(1:15 - 2:30)*

### **Demo Setup** *(1:15 - 1:25)*
**[Show real receipts and phone ready]**

**NARRATOR**: "Let me show you how it works. I have real receipts here, and I'm going to scan them live - no editing, no tricks."

### **First Receipt Scan** *(1:25 - 1:55)*
**[Live camera capture of receipt, show processing]**

**NARRATOR**: "I'll open Checkstand, point the camera at this receipt, and capture. Watch the status indicator - 'Gemma 3n' shows our AI model is ready. Now I'll take the photo..."

**[Show processing indicator: "Processing receipt..."]**

**NARRATOR**: "Behind the scenes, three things happen instantly: First, optical character recognition extracts the text. Then, Google's Gemma 3n model - running entirely on this device - analyzes that text. Finally, smart parsing extracts the merchant, date, and total amount."

### **Results Reveal** *(1:55 - 2:10)*
**[Show parsed receipt data]**

**NARRATOR**: "And there we have it! Target, July 15th, $24.00 - perfectly extracted in about 24 seconds. All processing happened on this device, with zero internet connection required."

### **Second Receipt for Reliability** *(2:10 - 2:30)*
**[Quick second demo]**

**NARRATOR**: "Let me try another one to show consistency... Perfect! Another receipt processed accurately. This isn't a tech demo - it's a production-ready application."

## **SCENE 4: Technical Innovation** *(2:30 - 3:00)*

### **Under the Hood** *(2:30 - 2:50)*
**[Show architecture diagram or code snippets]**

**NARRATOR**: "What makes this possible? Checkstand implements a sophisticated multimodal AI pipeline. We use Google's MediaPipe framework to run the 3.1GB Gemma 3n model locally, combined with ML Kit for OCR, all wrapped in a Clean Architecture with robust error handling and smart fallbacks."

### **Privacy Focus** *(2:50 - 3:00)*
**[Show "offline" indicator, airplane mode demo]**

**NARRATOR**: "The privacy implications are profound. Your financial data never leaves your device. It works in airplane mode, in remote areas, in countries with strict data laws - anywhere you need it."

---

## **SCENE 5: Real-World Impact** *(3:00 - 3:30)*

### **Use Cases** *(3:00 - 3:20)*
**[Show different user scenarios: small business, personal finance, accessibility]**

**NARRATOR**: "Who benefits? Small business owners tracking expenses for taxes. Individuals managing personal budgets. People in crisis situations processing insurance claims without internet. Those concerned about financial privacy. Visually impaired users who can leverage voice feedback."

### **The Bigger Picture** *(3:20 - 3:30)*
**[Show global connectivity challenges]**

**NARRATOR**: "In a world where 3 billion people lack reliable internet access, on-device AI isn't just convenient - it's democratizing technology."

---

## **SCENE 6: Call to Action** *(3:30 - 4:00)*

### **Competition Context** *(3:30 - 3:45)*
**[Show Google Gemma 3n Challenge logo]**

**NARRATOR**: "This is our submission for the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge, specifically targeting the Google AI Edge Prize for showcasing compelling on-device AI applications."

### **Future Vision** *(3:45 - 4:00)*
**[Show code repository, download links]**

**NARRATOR**: "The complete source code is available under CC BY 4.0 license. Try Checkstand yourself - because your financial privacy shouldn't be the price of convenience. This is AI that works for you, not against you."
