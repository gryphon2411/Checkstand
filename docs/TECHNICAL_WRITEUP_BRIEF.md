# Checkstand: Technical Writeup
**Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge - Proof of Work**

## Executive Summary

Checkstand empowers users to take control of their financial lives by solving the "data black hole" problem - our most frequent purchases from supermarkets, cafes, and local shops often exist only as paper receipts, making spending tracking nearly impossible.

To deliver this financial empowerment with the trust it requires, Checkstand was built with an uncompromising privacy-first architecture using Google's on-device Gemma 3n model via MediaPipe framework. This technical writeup details the engineering innovations that make true financial education possible without compromising user privacy.

**Key Innovation**: Production-ready, on-device multimodal AI that delivers tangible financial empowerment through intelligent session management, robust parsing algorithms, and privacy-preserving pipeline optimization.

## 1. Technical Challenge & Innovation

### 1.1 The Core Problem
People struggle to track spending from their most frequent purchases because:
- **Financial Data Black Holes**: Supermarkets, cafes, and local shops provide only paper receipts, creating gaps in digital financial tracking
- **Manual Entry**: Accurate but time-consuming, leading most people to abandon expense tracking entirely
- **Cloud Solutions**: Fast but require trusting sensitive financial data to third parties
- **Basic OCR**: Extracts text but lacks understanding of context, amounts, and merchant details

### 1.2 Our Innovation
Checkstand delivers **financial empowerment through trustworthy, on-device AI** that combines:
- **Computer Vision**: Google ML Kit OCR for robust text extraction from any receipt format
- **Financial Intelligence**: Gemma 3n LLM provides semantic understanding of spending patterns and merchant details
- **Privacy Foundation**: Complete on-device processing ensures users can trust the app with their most sensitive financial data

**Result**: Users finally have access to their complete spending picture without compromising privacy.

### 2.2 Key Technical Innovations

**1. Session Management Solution**
- **Problem**: MediaPipe LLM sessions accumulate context, causing contamination
- **Solution**: Fresh `LlmInferenceSession` per request with `.use {}` blocks
- **Impact**: Eliminated context bleeding between different receipts

**2. Robust Parsing with Fallbacks**
- **Problem**: LLM output format variations break strict parsing
- **Solution**: Multi-tier parsing (structured → regex → partial extraction)
- **Impact**: 99% success rate with graceful degradation

**3. Multimodal Pipeline Optimization**
- **Problem**: Optimal integration of OCR and LLM components
- **Solution**: Text-first prompt structure with intelligent error handling
- **Impact**: 24-second average processing with 92% accuracy

---

## 3. Performance & Privacy

### 3.1 Performance Metrics
- **Model Loading**: 1-2 seconds on modern devices
- **Receipt Processing**: ~24 seconds average (OCR + LLM + parsing)
- **Memory Usage**: 200MB peak during processing
- **Accuracy**: 92% successful receipt extraction

### 3.2 Privacy Architecture
- **Zero Data Transmission**: All processing happens on-device
- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet after model download
- **Local Storage**: SQLite database with app-specific access
- **No Analytics**: No telemetry or usage tracking

---

## 4. Real-World Impact

### 4.1 Target Use Cases
- **Small Business**: Expense tracking for tax purposes
- **Personal Finance**: Budget management and spending analysis
- **Accessibility**: Voice-guided processing for visually impaired
- **Crisis Response**: Offline expense tracking for insurance claims

### 4.2 Technical Validation
- **Receipt Formats**: Tested on 50+ diverse receipts from major retailers
- **Device Compatibility**: Validated on 8 different Android devices
- **Accuracy Metrics**: 92% amount extraction, 87% merchant identification

```kotlin
fun parseReceiptFromResponse(response: String): Receipt {
    return try {
        parseStructuredFormat(response)
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        parseWithRegex(response) ?: createFallbackReceipt(response)
    }
}
