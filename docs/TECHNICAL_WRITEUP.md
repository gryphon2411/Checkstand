# Checkstand: Technical Writeup
**Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge 2025**  
*The Proof of Work - Demonstrating Engineering Excellence*

---

## Executive Summary

Checkstand is a financial empowerment tool designed to help users take control of their spending by digitizing physical receipts. In a world where our most frequent purchases from supermarkets and local shops create a "data black hole," Checkstand provides the crucial, previously missing insights.

To deliver this powerful capability with the trust it requires, Checkstand was built with an uncompromising privacy-first architecture. By leveraging Google's on-device Gemma 3n model, the entire AI pipeline—from OCR to language analysis—runs locally. No user data ever leaves the phone.

**Key Innovation**: A production-ready, on-device multimodal AI that provides tangible financial education and empowerment, made possible *because* of its privacy-preserving design.

## Development Journey: From Cross-Platform to Native Excellence

### Architecture Evolution - A Real-World AI Deployment Story

Checkstand's development journey exemplifies the practical challenges of deploying large AI models in mobile applications. Our path from React Native to pure Android native reveals critical insights about on-device AI constraints.

**Initial Approach: React Native/Expo (July 18, 2025)**
We began with React Native for cross-platform efficiency. The initial implementation included:
- Complete UI framework with navigation
- MediaPipe integration planning
- Standard Expo/Metro bundler setup

**The Constraint: Metro Bundler Limitation**
When integrating the 4.4GB Gemma 3n model, we encountered Metro bundler's hard 2GB file size limit. This wasn't a theoretical problem - it was a deployment blocker.

**Creative Solution: Custom Native Module**
Rather than compromising, we developed a sophisticated workaround:
```java
// NativeModelLoaderModule.java
public class NativeModelLoaderModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {
    @ReactMethod
    public void loadModel(Promise promise) {
        // Bypass bundler by copying 4.4GB model at runtime
        copyAssetToStorage("gemma_3n.task");
        promise.resolve(getModelPath());
    }
}
```

**Strategic Pivot: Pure Native Android**
While the native module worked, we made the strategic decision to pivot to pure Android native. Why?
- **Performance**: Direct MediaPipe integration without React Native bridge overhead
- **Reliability**: Simpler architecture reduces potential failure points  
- **Optimization**: Native code allows fine-tuned memory management for large models
- **Maintenance**: Single codebase focused on Android's AI capabilities

This decision demonstrates engineering maturity - choosing the right tool for the job over development convenience.

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

Checkstand implements a **Clean Architecture** pattern with three distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose in the receipt processing pipeline:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │    │     Domain      │    │      Data       │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ • UI Screens    │◄──►│ • Use Cases     │◄──►│ • Repositories  │
│ • ViewModels    │    │ • Models        │    │ • Services      │
│ • Compose UI    │    │ • Interfaces    │    │ • Database      │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Multimodal AI Pipeline
The heart of Checkstand's innovation lies in its sophisticated multimodal processing pipeline:

**Phase 1: Image Capture**
- CameraX integration for real-time preview and capture
- Gallery selection with proper image orientation handling
- Bitmap optimization for processing efficiency

**Phase 2: Optical Character Recognition**
- Google ML Kit Text Recognition API
- Handles various receipt formats and lighting conditions
- Extracts raw text with confidence scoring

**Phase 3: Language Model Analysis**
- Gemma 3n (3.1GB E2B model) via MediaPipe framework
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent output
- Context-aware analysis of extracted receipt text

**Phase 4: Intelligent Parsing**
- Primary: Structured format parsing (`MERCHANT:`, `DATE:`, `TOTAL:`)
- Fallback: Regex-based amount extraction
- Error recovery with partial data preservation

#### 2. Session Management Innovation

**Challenge**: MediaPipe LLM sessions accumulate context, causing contamination between different receipt analyses.

**Solution**: Fresh session creation per request using the `.use{}` pattern:

```kotlin
suspend fun generateResponse(prompt: String): String {
    return LlmInference.createFromOptions(context, options).use { inference ->
        inference.generateResponse(prompt)
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Eliminated context bleeding, improved accuracy, consistent processing times.

#### 3. Robust Error Handling

**Multi-tier Parsing Strategy**:
1. **Structured Parsing**: Attempts to parse LLM response in expected format
2. **Regex Fallback**: Extracts monetary amounts using pattern matching
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Preserves partial data with user notification

```kotlin
private fun createFallbackReceipt(extractedText: String, originalResponse: String): Receipt {
    val amounts = extractedText.extractAmounts()
    val totalAmount = amounts.maxOrNull() ?: BigDecimal.ZERO
    
    return Receipt(
        merchantName = "Unknown Merchant",
        totalAmount = totalAmount,
        date = Date(),
        rawText = extractedText,
        llmResponse = originalResponse
    )
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Injection with Hilt

Checkstand uses Hilt for clean dependency management:

```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object ServiceModule {
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideLLMService(@ApplicationContext context: Context): LLMService {
        return LLMService(context)
    }
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideOCRService(): OCRService {
        return OCRService()
    }
}
```

### UI Architecture with Jetpack Compose

Modern Android UI built with declarative patterns:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun InvoiceCaptureScreen() {
    val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    val modelStatus by viewModel.modelStatus.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    
    // Status chip shows real-time model state
    AssistChip(
        label = { Text(
            when {
                uiState.isProcessing -> "Gemma 3n"
                modelStatus == ModelStatus.READY -> "Gemma 3n"
                modelStatus == ModelStatus.LOADING -> "Loading Gemma 3n"
                else -> "Unknown"
            }
        )}
    )
}
```

### Database Layer with Room

Efficient local storage for receipt data:

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "receipts")
data class ReceiptEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val merchantName: String,
    val totalAmount: String,
    val date: Long,
    val createdAt: Long
)
```
