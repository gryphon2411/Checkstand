## üö® **Risk Mitigation**

### **High-Risk Items:**
1. **Video Demo Failure**: App doesn't work during filming
   - **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly beforehand, have backup receipts
2. **Technical Issues**: Recording software problems
   - **Mitigation**: Test all equipment 2 days before filming
3. **Time Crunch**: Running out of time for quality production
   - **Mitigation**: Start video work immediately, focus on core demo
4. **üö® Kaggle Submission Failure**: Forgetting to submit writeup
   - **Mitigation**: Set calendar reminders, submit early (Aug 3-4)
5. **‚è∞ Missing Deadline**: Submitting on Aug 6 instead of before
   - **Mitigation**: Target Aug 5 submission, Aug 4 as backup

### **Contingency Plans:**
- **Video Backup**: If live demo fails, use screen recording of working app
- **Simplified Scope**: Focus on core functionality demo vs. fancy production
- **Time Management**: Prioritize working demo over perfect polish
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Submission Backup**: Submit initial writeup early, can edit later
- **üö® Deadline Safety**: Submit by Aug 5 at latest, not Aug 6!
