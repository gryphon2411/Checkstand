## üéØ The Problem: Financial Data Black Holes

In today's economy, tracking expenses is crucial. Yet, our most frequent purchases‚Äîfrom supermarkets, cafes, and local shops‚Äîoften end up as paper receipts, creating a black hole in our financial data. With **~60% of Americans lacking a formal budget** and **18% of all payments still made in cash**, a huge volume of financial data is lost. How can people control their spending if they can't track it?

**Checkstand's Answer:** Empower users with a tool that digitizes physical receipts, providing crucial financial insights that were previously lost.

## ‚ú® What Makes Checkstand Special

- **üí∞ Financial Empowerment**: Finally track spending from supermarkets and local shops that don't offer digital records.
- **üéì Educational Insights**: Understand where your money goes, identify spending patterns, and take control of your budget.
- **üîí Uncompromising Privacy**: Your financial data is sensitive. Checkstand processes everything on-device, so your information never leaves your phone. It's your data, your insights, your control.
- **üß† Multimodal AI**: A powerful on-device pipeline combining Camera, OCR, and Gemma 3n to understand any receipt.
- **üì± Offline-First**: Works anywhere, anytime, without needing an internet connection.
- **‚ö° Real-Time**: Process receipts in ~24 seconds on consumer hardware
- **üéØ Practical Impact**: Solves real financial tracking problems

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Innovation**

### **Gemma 3n Integration**
- **On-Device Inference**: 4.4GB E4B model running locally via MediaPipe
- **Session Management**: Fresh inference sessions per request (prevents context contamination)
- **Multimodal Pipeline**: Seamless integration of image and text processing

### **Architecture Highlights**
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain/Data/UI separation with Hilt dependency injection
- **Robust Parsing**: Smart fallback mechanisms when LLM output varies
- **Camera Integration**: CameraX with real-time preview and capture
- **Modern Android**: Jetpack Compose UI with Material 3 design

### **Why Native Android?**
*Development Journey Note*: We initially explored React Native for cross-platform efficiency, but encountered Metro bundler's 2GB file size limitation with our 4.4GB Gemma 3n model. While we successfully created a custom native module workaround, we ultimately chose pure Android native for optimal performance and simplified architecture. This decision exemplifies choosing the right tool for AI deployment constraints.

### ‚ú® **Latest Updates**
- **Material Design Icons**: Professional vector drawables replace emoji icons
- **Clean UX**: Removed confusing processing notifications  
- **Background Processing**: Queue system with timeout handling
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Clear receipt processing states

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer
- Android device with API level 24+ (Android 7.0)
- 4GB+ RAM (recommended for optimal model performance)

### **Build & Run**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gryphon2411/Checkstand.git
cd Checkstand
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### **Installation**
1. Enable "Unknown Sources" in Android settings
2. Install the generated APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
3. Grant camera permission when prompted
4. Start scanning receipts!

## üß† **How It Works**

1. **Image Capture**: User scans receipt with camera or selects from gallery
2. **OCR Processing**: Google ML Kit extracts text from receipt image
3. **AI Analysis**: Gemma 3n processes text to identify merchant, date, total
4. **Smart Parsing**: Robust extraction with intelligent fallbacks
5. **Local Storage**: All data stays on device in local database

## üìä **Quantified Impact & Market Size**

Checkstand addresses a massive, underserved market by providing a private, educational tool for financial empowerment.

- **Budget-Conscious Households (~79M in U.S.)**: A simple, effective tool for the 60% of U.S. households that do not have a formal budget.
- **Freelancers & Gig Workers (~64M in U.S.)**: Meticulous, offline-first expense tracking for the 38% of the workforce that needs it for tax purposes and managing variable income.
- **The Cash-Reliant Population (~36M in U.S.)**: Serves the ~14% of U.S. adults who use cash for most purchases and are excluded from mainstream digital finance apps.
- **Privacy-Aware Users**: In a market where **~79% of consumers are concerned about data privacy**, Checkstand's on-device AI is a critical differentiator that builds essential trust.

## üèÜ **Competition Alignment**
